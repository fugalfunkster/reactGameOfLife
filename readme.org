* React Game of Life

** Description
Based on Conways "Game of Life" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
My implementation uses React's lifecycle methods to calculate the next state and rerender as soon as the prior rendering completes. It's wicked fast. And, I made it responsive, so the game board's size is calculated to fit the user's device.
